              <h2 id="attend">How Do I Attend a Call?</h2>
              <p>We use UberConference and IRC for our conference calls. You can dial in by browsing to
                <a href="https://www.uberconference.com/hydra-cg">https://www.uberconference.com/hydra-cg</a>.
                Please also connect your IRC client to <a href="irc://irc.w3.org:6665/#hydra">irc://irc.w3.org:6665/#hydra</a>
                or use <a href="http://irc.w3.org/?channels=hydra">W3C's web IRC</a>. IRC is used to manage the
                speaker queue, scribe, share links etc.</p>
              <p>The dates and times of the calls as well as the agenda can be found on the
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/hydra/wiki/Conference_Calls">conference calls page in our wiki</a>.
                Feel free to add items to the agenda that you'd like to discuss.</p>
              <p>After you connected and the call started ask Zakim, our IRC meeting bot, to put you on the speaker
                queue:</p>
              <code>
                zakim, queue+
              </code>
              <p>You can see who's on the queue with</p>
              <code>
                zakim, queue?
              </code>
              <p>If you want to remove yourself from the queue again, just write</p>
              <code>
                zakim, queue-
              </code>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <h2 id="scribe">How Do I Run a Call and Scribe?</h2>
              <p>We use a few bots to run our conference calls. Please invite them before the conference
                call starts by issuing the following commands in IRC:</p>
              <code>
                /invite RRSAgent #hydra<br>
                /invite Zakim #hydra
              </code>
              <p>After the bots joined the IRC channel, you start the meeting and tell the bots what it is about<br>
                (plus points for deep linking the
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/hydra/wiki/Conference_Calls#Agenda">right agenda</a>):</p>
              <code>
                trackbot, start meeting<br>
                <br>
                Zakim, this is https://www.uberconference.com/hydra-cg<br>
                <br>
                Meeting: Hydra W3C Community Group Conference Call<br>
                Chair: Markus Lanthaler<br>
                Agenda: https://www.w3.org/community/hydra/wiki/Conference_Calls#<i>Agenda</i>
              </code>
              <p>As people join the call, they should mark their presence (you can also do it on their behalf) using
                the following command &mdash; inserting their user name and removing the angle brackets:</p>
              <code>
                present+ <i>&lt;IRC user name&gt;</i>
              </code>
              <p>The last thing before starting the call is to elect a scribe and document who it is with the following
                command:</p>
              <code>
                Scribe: <i>&lt;IRC user name&gt;</i>
              </code>
              <p>After this, the chair moderates the call. He will signal the start of a new topic on IRC with</p>
              <code>
                Topic: <i>&lt;Title of the topic that is being discussed&gt;</i>
              </code>
              <p>The scribe then transcribes what has been said by typing the user name of the person speaking
                followed by a colon and the statement such as in the example below:</p>
              <code>
                markus: I like this approach
              </code>
              <p>Literal transcription is not necessary but usually simpler than trying to summarize someone else's
                thoughts on the fly. A statement can be split into multiple lines. Please proceed continuations with
                three dots such as in</p>
              <code>
                markus: I like this approach<br>
                ... it is much clearer than the previous ones<br>
                ... and solves the problem completely
              </code>
              <p>If the scribe speaks, someone else can &mdash; and should &mdash; take over and
                scribe the statement in exactly the same way.</p>
              <p>Action items, proposals and resolutions can be recorded as follows:</p>
              <code>
                ACTION: <i>&lt;Markus to clean up meeting notes&gt;</i><br>
                PROPOSAL: <i>&lt;Make Hydra more generic by introducing...&gt;</i><br>
                RESOLVED: <i>&lt;Make Hydra more generic by introducing...&gt;</i>
              </code>
              <p>At the end of the meeting you can request RRSAgent  to publish the meeting notes (this is for W3C;
                we store them on <a href="https://github.com/HydraCG/Minutes">GitHub</a>) and ask RRSAgent and Zakim
                to leave the channel:</p>
              <code>
                rrsagent, please publish the minutes<br>
                rrsagent, please make these logs world-visible<br>
                <br>
                rrsagent, bye<br>
                zakim, bye
              </code>
              <p>After the call, please spend a few minutes to clean up the minutes, convert them to HTML and
                create a pull request to upload them to GitHub:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Create a new folder using the date of the conference call in the format <i>yyyy-mm-dd</i>.</li>
                <li>Create a file <i>irc.log</i> containing the IRC log of the conference call.</li>
                <li>Open <a href="http://www.hydra-cg.com/minutes/scribetool/">scribetool</a> and paste the
                  IRC log in to the text field at the bottom of the screen.</li>
                <li>Spend two minutes to check the nicely formatted minutes.
                  <ul>
                    <li> Are all the fields at the top such as the agenda, the scribe and the participants
                      populated correctly?</li>
                    <li>Is every statement attributed to the right person (it sometimes happens that you forget
                      the three dots for a continuation)?</li>
                    <li>Are all action items, proposals and resolutions marked up correctly?</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Switch to HTML mode by clicking the "Show HTML" button on the right and copy the result
                  into a file called <i>index.html</i>.</li>
                <li>Create a pull request to add the folder containing the two files to
                  <a href="https://github.com/HydraCG/Minutes">HydraCG/Minutes on GitHub</a> and give owners
                  permissions to add files to your pull request (this will be used to add the audio recording).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Finally, please send the meeting minutes to <a href="mailto:public-hydra@w3.org">public-hydra@w3.org</a>.
                You can use scribetool's text output.</p>
