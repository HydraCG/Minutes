[20:11] <Karol_Szczepanski> Topic: Discuss Hydra relation to SHACL #214
[20:15] <Karol_Szczepanski> tpluskiewicz: in terms of expects/returns the issue could be actually closed
[20:16] <Karol_Szczepanski> tpluskiewicz: if we want to be opened as a vocabulary it doesn't make any point of adding any possible external vocabulary representation into those predicate's range
[20:16] <Karol_Szczepanski> SerialSeb: I disagree
[20:16] <Karol_Szczepanski> SerialSeb: expect/return is still a hydra resource
[20:17] <Karol_Szczepanski> SerialSeb: my issue is there is an implicit assumption hydra resource should support GET
[20:17] <Karol_Szczepanski> SerialSeb: in JSON-schema or CQRS like approach there is no resultion for the actions sent by the client
[20:18] <Karol_Szczepanski> SerialSeb: I'm not sure that the entity body desription should have to be a hydra resource
[20:19] <Karol_Szczepanski> SerialSeb: endpoint might support image, which is not resolvable
[20:22] <Karol_Szczepanski> tpluskiewicz: Client is really required to try to dereference a resource
[20:22] <Karol_Szczepanski> tpluskiewicz: it may choose to dereference it, but it is up to the client
[20:27] <Karol_Szczepanski> SerialSeb: I have no way of sasying a given ID is not dereferencable
[20:31] <Karol_Szczepanski> SerialSeb: SerialSeb: I have same issue with supportedClass is not able to display information about non-hydra resources
[20:31] <Karol_Szczepanski> tpluskiewicz: using RDF means machine readability through HTTP
[20:36] <Karol_Szczepanski> tpluskiewicz: SHACL can describe RDF, so using JSON-schema wouldn't work
[20:38] <Karol_Szczepanski> SerialSeb: that's wju I'd love to see rdf:Resource as root for hydra expect/returns and supportedClass
[20:44] <Karol_Szczepanski> SerialSeb: I know that server won't support GET method for some resources and I have no way of documenting that
[20:48] <SerialSeb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPRange-14
[20:50] <Karol_Szczepanski> Karol_Szczepanski: downgrading hydra:Resource to rdf:Resource could be a braking change
[20:51] <Karol_Szczepanski> Karol_Szczepanski: only viable solutio I can see now is to explicitely forbid something
[21:09] <Karol_Szczepanski> ACTION: Karol_Szczepanski raises an issue and introduce solution on how to resolve forbidden GET operation
[21:17] <SerialSeb> https://www.w3.org/2019/wot/json-schema
[21:19] <Karol_Szczepanski> tpluskiewicz: my only issue with opening up to rdf:Resource is client would need to understand potentially non-machine readable resources, which makes the client non-generic anymore
