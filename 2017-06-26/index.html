              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  karol would you like to give us quick update ?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  I made new commit yesterday which addressed most of the feedback</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I still don't have this 'lazy parsing', possibly I would leave it for the future</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... up to you (Markus) if you need it now or we can wait</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I don't see it as blocking issue</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  everything now stays behind interfaces facade so we can replace everything behind it later</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  did you already add a TODO ?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  in general i try to stick to the Use Cases</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... currently we have a little bit of implementation</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... ApiDocumentation fetching and EntryPoint fetching</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... we should have some integration tests based on Ucs</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... i would like to root it in the use cases</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I meant just a comment with TODO just as a reminder for what we discussed and decided to address in the future</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  we can also create issues in the gh repo</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  creating an issue sounds like a good way to go</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... in general if someone creates PR and we want to defer addressing some of the issues, creating gh issues makes sense</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  I'll create issues for what we want to deffer from this PR</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I find it difficult to track of all those comments we make in PR reviews</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... do you know any other tool that might handle it better</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... if author of the PR could mark a thread as addressed or not</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... i could suggest something after small research</div>
              <div id="action-1" class="action"><strong>ACTION</strong>: Markus will try to find a tool which will help us with PR reviews; it's currently difficult to keep track what has been addressed and what hasn't</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  one question regarding my PR</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... this 10 days long discussion stops me from further development</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... how we can speed up our PR process so it doesn't block my development</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... from my perspective current pace feels slow</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... waiting 10 days seems to long</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  maybe making smaller PRs will make things faster</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... this one as initial one included a lot of things</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... if you nail down interfaces first, which requires most discussion</div>
              <div class="information">and focus on implementation later this would speed things up</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  IMO our needs have to be a driver, it may benefit a final outcome if requirements drive it</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  interfaces could be driven by use cases, what user of this library would need to work with given use case</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  i'll try to think it over and will propose something to the community</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  what next things you would like to work on?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  i would like to start with integration tests, and add datasets based on our use cases</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... so that we can start extracting some data that other implementations could eventually also use</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  given we didn't come up with a specific solution on how to speed it up, maybe also you could ask on mailing list for reviews</div>
              <div class="information">and when you see it ready to merge we can make a 'last call' on mailing list to ask if anyone objects</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  I think if we get disciplined and keep focused in PRs we could get much faster [scribe assist by Markus Lanthaler]</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... we shouldn't get sidetracked by unrelated stuff but move that aggresively to separate issues</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  we should try everything what could speed up the process</div>

              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  I'm not sure this is worth discussing yet but given we have time... [scribe assist by Markus Lanthaler]</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I think we should find a better pattern for links in the EntryPoint that point to collections of resources of a specific type</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... the example was the "events" link in the EntryPoint that points to a collection containing all Events</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... we need to be able to describe that to a client in a better way</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  We discussed this before in the context of Data Shapes [scribe assist by Markus Lanthaler]</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... OWL would be another solution</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... but it opens a can of worms and may be difficult for the client to use</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>: SHACL was the name</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  OWL works and has capacity to express it, but it opens a can of worms that it has a lot of power and clients should have to fully implement it</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... class partition seems nice, but hydra should handle it natively give as common use case in APIs</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... we should investigate options of nice short pattern</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  we could use issue #126 to discuss it in more detail</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  I'll post a link how SOLID solves this [scribe assist by Markus Lanthaler]</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... OWL has something but it doesn't seem practical in real world scenarios</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... we should come up with a better solution</div>
              <div id="action-2" class="action"><strong>ACTION</strong>: Markus to rename issue #126 to not suggest a solution</div>

              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  Currently the use case is only events [scribe assist by Markus Lanthaler]</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... if there would be two or more types the problem would become more apparent</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... Karol, what do you think about extending the use cases to show this?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  Sure, I'm open to extending the use cases [scribe assist by Markus Lanthaler]</div>
