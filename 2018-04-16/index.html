              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  the first AI was: Markus to write down a proposal on how a expects "request shape" could look like</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  didn't have time to get this done, will send it out the next couple of days</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  the second AI was: Karol, to extend use cases to include ApiDocumentation examples</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  same here</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... was busy with PRs</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  the third AI was: Pavlik, to create issue regarding subject in POSTs etc. - Issue-162: managing @id and/or @base for newly created resources / named graphs</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>: <a href="https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/issues/162">https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/issues/162</a></div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  I created ISSUE-162</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I probably tried to capture too many things in there</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I describe in there how a server can accept a POST with a blank node</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... and decide which node to pick</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... with multiple nodes it isn't so obvious for the server which resource to pick and assign IDs</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  did anyone have a chance to read ISSUE-162 already?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  me and Tomasz already replied</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... if the server expects a single resource is it allowed to pass a graph?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  I think it's just a serialization detail</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... but there might be differences between PUT and POST</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  yeah, in a PUT the client knows what happens and can use full IRIs instead of blank nodes</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... can a relative IRI be used in a POST?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  we discussed that before.. but I don't remember the outcome</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  if you request something and get back relative URLs</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... the base is taken from the request URL</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  yeah, unless it is overridden in the context</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  I think that still holds for a POST</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  the IRI you are POSTing to might be completely unrelated to what you are posting</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  in that case, the server should ignore the @id the client provides</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  when you say @id, you only mean the single, top-level node, right?</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... the client could send a graph with multiple resources</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  you make a good point</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... looking at it as triples it is not obvious what the "root" is</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... might be worth checking what the Linked Data Platform did</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  I'll change my pull request to only cover the case with a single blank node which would be the root node</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  I think assigning the ID is just a subset of the problem</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... the general question is what's the root resource within the client-supplied graph</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  for use case 5 with POST a single resource with a blank node</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... don't you think it would be worthwhile clarifying that use case</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  adding a note is fine</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... but I wouldn't go into too much detail just yet</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  Pavlik, you could send a POST with a concrete @id</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  it may re-assign a different IRI then</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  maybe... or perhaps it would incorporate it as a separate resource into the graph</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... or replace the IRI</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... there are other options as well</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  I think this would be easier to discuss on GitHub</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  yeah, let's do that</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  I have another use case where I PUT a triple but don't want to create a new resource</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  the PUT already defines the IRI</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... regardless of what you put in the payload</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... PUT tells the server to makes a resource out of the payload</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  are you actually talking about a PATCH?</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... with a PUT you want to tell the server to replace the resource</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... but the client can't make too many assumptions about what exactly the server does</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... further, you are just doing a POST</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... which doesn't have any semantics</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... just POSTing a triple isn't enough to derive the semantics</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  it would be nice to see real-world use cases for these scenarios</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  a use case might be to allow an attendee to be attached to an event directly, i.e., without creating an intermediary collection resource</div>
              <div class="error">Error: (IRC nickname not recognized)[20:26] &lt;markus&gt; ... that could be expressed with a single triple &lt;/event&gt; schema:attendee &lt;/attendee&gt;</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  fair enough.. but it is a implementation detail on the server</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  think of it as a named graph</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>: <a href="https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/pull/154/commits/33ab45ae4bfbea89e30c8c4f8df8043720d87f4b">https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/pull/154/commits/33ab45ae4bfbea89e30c8c4f8df8043720d87f4b</a></div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  the commit I just referenced shows how this might work</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  isn't this more of a PATCH?</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... like patching the event resource to add a new attendee?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  not really, the relationships here have their own URLs as you see described with the IRI template</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  this looks very complex while at the same time being very abstract</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... you are adding triple patterns, adding subjects and predicates etc.</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... the average Hydra consumer doesn't want to deal with this</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  how would it work otherwise?</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... it could think of a RPC-style POST</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I'm open to alternatives</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  quick idea.. the event could provide a collection for attendees</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  right, but then you would POST a resource with a known IRI which would then create a new resource which just points to the person attending the event</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I would like to have something which doesn't need this extra complexity</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... maybe as extension for people who are more interested in the linked data</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  an alternative might be to use the LINK method</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  wasn't it deprecated in HTTP/1.1?</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... we should look it up</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  also, there's currently no way to describe the necessary HTTP headers with Hydra</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  is there anything else we want to discuss in regard to PR-154 (Actions with explicit target)</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  what are the next steps</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  if no one has a more concrete idea I think we need to iterate on it further</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... GitHub is probably the better place to do so</div>

              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  I think the only remaining question is whether to expose the getHypermediaProcessor() method</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I think it will be useful</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I don't think that's a blocker</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... let's proceed with the PR</div>

              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  might be because I haven't set it up</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I'll check</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  I think this shouldn't eagerly load the whole collection</div>

              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I guess there's a test that could act as snippet</div>
