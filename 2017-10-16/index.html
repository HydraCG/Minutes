              <h1 id="topic-1" class="topic">Topic: CreateAction with HTTP PUT</h1>
              <div class="information"><a href="https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/issues/141">https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/issues/141</a></div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  we approached this from two difficult use cases</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... adding members to collections</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... and creating resources</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... it seems either way we will need IriTemplates</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>: <a href="https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/issues/141#issuecomment-336670989">https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/issues/141#issuecomment-336670989</a></div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  if we use CreateAction it could be both POST or PUT</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... it would look pretty much the same if we would have a way to attach a "target template"</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... telling the client how to construct the URL</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  we already have a similar functionality with templates and links</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>: comment trying to follow hydra:search approach <a href="https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/issues/3#issuecomment-336635276">https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/issues/3#issuecomment-336635276</a></div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  indeed my latest PR is quite similar to Pavlik's snippet</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I think hydra:search is a link. It is not clear to me if we can use this pattern for this as well</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  we could also change hydra:search to SearchAction and have that operation point to a IRI template</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>: { "create_user": { "@type": "IriTemplate", "operation": { "expects": "NewUser" } } }</div>
              <div class="information">when I designed Hydra the intent was to have IriTemplate work pretty much work like a "abstract" hydra:Resource</div>
              <div class="information">once the variables in the template are replaced, it would work the same</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  does this mean we need to describe things differently based on their HTTP method</div>
              <div class="information">{ "@type": "IriTemplate", "template": "whatever?{var}", "mappings": [..], "operation": { "@type": "CreateAction", "expects": "NewUser", ... } } }</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>: I'm experiencing connection issues :(</div>
              <div class="information"><a href="http://schema.org/Action">http://schema.org/Action</a></div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  right, so if I would like to describe how to add something to a collection with a PUT, how would I point to the IRI template?</div>
              <div class="information">that's indeed undefined at the moment</div>
              <div class="information">Schema.org has things like instrument, agent, object etc. to describe some of these relationships</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  I used action to describe this on GitHub</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>: <a href="https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/issues/141#issuecomment-336670989">https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/issues/141#issuecomment-336670989</a></div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  I think we are overthinking this</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... we could leverage the follow your nose principle and let the user decide</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... how we could tell a client the consequence of an operation beforehand is an open problem though</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... maybe not as important though unless we want to target machine to machine communication</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... in general though I agree that an extension on collections would be nice</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  if we would like to describe an HTTP request for a resource directly, we would use hydra:operation or its inverse hydra:target</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... if the client needs to send the HTTP request to a different resource to affect the current one, we could use hydra:action as proposed in <a href="https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/issues/141#issuecomment-336670989">https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/issues/141#issuecomment-336670989</a></div>
              <div class="information">So, what you propose is to introduce an additional property "hydra:action" whose semantics are "there's an operation that affects *this* resource but needs to be send to a *different* URL (specified with hydra:operation or hydra:target)"</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  could we make the method determine which resource the request should go to?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  if you look at Pavlik's example they are uniform</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>: actually, I meant the snippets in IRC. above</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  am I correct that you are making a distinction between an action and an operation?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  kind of, action is just a connection to a different resource</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  so PUT would go to action, POST would go to operation</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  I'd actually think the other way round</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  ok, right, so the other way round</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>: o_0</div>
              <div class="information">Let's take this back to GitHub</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>: q?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  Pavlik, your snippet has targetTemplate. Is this something you created?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  yeah, they are just proposals</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>: "action": { "@type": ["hydra:Operation", "schema:CreateAction", "hydra:IriTemplate"],</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  what would it mean if action is simultanously an operation and an IRI template?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  we shouldn't conflate operations and resources</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... and the way Markus described IriTemplates as "abstract resources" think describes well that we shouldn't conflate them</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  I wouldn't like to see them conflated either</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I'll rewrite Pavlik's snippet to how Markus described it</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  there's the third option which is how it is in the PR</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... let the HTTP method decide</div>
              <div class="information">I think that would be too restrictive.. a POST could need to go to a different URL as well, not just a PUT</div>
              <div class="information">Let's spend a few more cycles on GitHub and discuss it again next time</div>
              <div class="information">The next topic would be "Adding already existing resources as collection members", as it's highly related I'd propose to table that as it is highly related unless someone disagrees</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  I touched on that in my PR but I had to use workaround as we miss IRI templates</div>
              <div class="information"><a href="https://github.com/HydraCG/Heracles.ts/pull/18">https://github.com/HydraCG/Heracles.ts/pull/18</a></div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  don't hesitate to comment on the PR, it was created for that exact purpose</div>
              <div class="information"><a href="https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/issues/118">https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/issues/118</a></div>
              <div class="information">The next topic is also highly related "Specifying operations on TemplatedLink objects", PR 118</div>
              <div class="information">The last topic "Should we introduce a property to associate operations and their target directly to an entity?" is also about the same thing</div>

              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  do we have a volunteer to create use cases for these?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  do you think we need use cases? Creating events with POST and PUT should already address them</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  maybe I can extend use case 5</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... maybe we conflate to connected but different matters</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... one is operations on IriTemplates</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... the other one is a PUT (which is a specialization of the other)</div>

              <div class="comment-continuation">... how is it configured</div>
