[20:08] <markus> sorry folks, I'm having issues with my connection
[20:08] <markus> I'll try to join via my mobile
[20:18] <Karol_Szczepanski> tpluskiewicz: what would be a procedure to expand specification with new features
[20:18] <Karol_Szczepanski> markus: PR would be a good starting point
[20:19] <Karol_Szczepanski> tpluskiewicz: shall we create an issue first and then a PR?
[20:21] <Karol_Szczepanski> markus: keeping use cases, reference client and spec in sync with few contributors may be quite difficult
[20:23] <Karol_Szczepanski> markus: ideal spec would be both specification and documentation altogether
[20:24] <Karol_Szczepanski> markus: as pure spec would be to formal, plain documentation would not have all the formalities required to make it work
[20:26] <Karol_Szczepanski> tpluskiewicz: maybe we shall publish the use cases as i.e. a website and then interlink it with the spec to provide examples, etc.
[20:28] <Karol_Szczepanski> tpluskiewicz: I just bounce between the spec and my attempts to use hydra and end up with not knowing on how to use i.e. templates or paging, etc.
[20:32] <Karol_Szczepanski> ACTION: Markus to render the use case documents on the Hydra homepage
[20:33] <Karol_Szczepanski> ACTION: Tomasz to come up with a rough structure of how the documentation should look like
