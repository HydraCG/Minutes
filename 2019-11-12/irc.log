[20:10] <Karol_Szczepanski> Topic: Get a grip on collection ordering issue #172
[20:10] <Karol_Szczepanski> https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/issues/172
[20:12] <aveltens> Karol: Ordering touches the querying topic. Not sure if this should be in hydra core, but should at least be extendible
[20:21] <tpluskiewicz> https://prefix.zazuko.com/dtype:orderIndex
[20:23] <aveltens> Karol: 2 possible solutions: Rising hydra:Collection to some kind of SortedCollection, impliying that the members are RDF Lists
[20:23] <aveltens> ... or leave it as is and provide a description of the ordering
[20:24] <aveltens> ... would be cautious with adding something to members
[20:24] <aveltens> ... like indices
[20:25] <Karol_Szczepanski> aveltens: I'm not sure what kind of use case Pieter has on his mind
[20:26] <Karol_Szczepanski> tpluskiewicz: i.e. for UI building, client would need to be sure on how the members are sorted
[20:28] <aveltens> Karol: The client could define an order in the query and expect the API to serve in that order
[20:29] <aveltens> ... same es an SQL or SPARQL queries
[20:31] <aveltens> Tomasz: The server should be able to indicate the order to the client, even if the client did not ask for a specific order
[20:32] <aveltens> ... if the response is ordered, the server should return an RDF list
[20:34] <aveltens> Karol: Pieters proposol is quite complex, introducing many new predicates / classes
[20:35] <aveltens> ... I prefer having quering for order as a stanard
[20:35] <aveltens> Tomasz: The client nontheless needs to understand what it got. Perhaps it followed only a parameterized link and does not understand what order it requested
[20:45] <aveltens> Karol: Even if a link is follows / refresh is done, the client will request a specific order based on it's state and knows about the order
[20:46] <aveltens> Tomasz: There are several issues here. What if the server implemention changed meanwhile?
[20:47] <aveltens> Angelo: The client would look up the API doc to know how to construct the query?
[20:48] <aveltens> Karol: We have to very different concepts. Querying the data vs shaping the data. Which path should we use? What are the benefits of each?
[20:49] <aveltens> Tomasz: What about a resource /people, and the server orders them implicitly by name
[20:49] <aveltens> ... its not about what the server has to do, but what the server did
[20:50] <aveltens> Karol: If client knows what it needs, let it ask for it, unless it should not care
[20:50] <aveltens> Karol: let us craft some imaginatory situations in the cookbook
[20:51] <aveltens> ... lets link those examples / use cases to the issue
[20:53] <aveltens> ACTION: Karol will provide example for the querying approach
[20:53] * RRSAgent records action 1
[20:54] <aveltens> Tomasz: Still, Pieter is asking for the complete opposite, Indicate a partial collection view is ordered
