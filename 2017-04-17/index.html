              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: ... main separation is API modeling vs. in-band controls</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: ... for each we have bits and pieces but some stuff is not complete (e.g. pagination)</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: ... I expect two kinds of feedback: 1) specifically on the diagram itself 2) what do people think of this diagram to move forward?</div>

              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: ... with a group I would like people to focus on a specific thing like fields e.g. for a month and then present progress</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: ... I for instance would be able to get a group of people at Gent University to write a spec for some subparts</div>
