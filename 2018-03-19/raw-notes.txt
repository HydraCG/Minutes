Hydra call 19.03.2018

Pavlik: there is a comment related to which part of parameters should
go into the body and which into the IRI template
Tomasz: Question is wether template variables should be extracted from
solely body of the resource or there are other sources
All: we agree on the fact that the resource cannot be the only source
of arguments/parameters
Pavlik: idea was to make the API operation agnostic - the difference
in the example was only in the HTTP verb, no other differences related
to filling the 'slug' parameter should be rellevant
Tomasz: how about switching both UC5 and UC5.1 to use new id so the
resulting event ends up with same URL
Pavlik: lets focus on Markus's example and use some UUID parameter
Tomasz: We shouldn't assume that all the resource's property are good
fit for URL parameters
Pavlik: maybe we should multiply examples with slugs and UUId (either
augogenerated by client or server)
Tomasz: the slug is not the issue, UUID generation is not the purpose
of the client (i.e. some custom form for UUID generation) and then we
should provide two objects to the request, one with target resource,
another with additional parameters
Pavlik: IRI variables are only mappings for properties
Pavlik: question is what is a subject in the variable mappings (i.e.
payload is the subject), which is unknown here
Pavlik: same with UUID, we don't know whether it should be a value of
the payload or it should be taken from other place
Tomasz: I've started somehow related questions in #152
Pavlik: take the snipped from Markus's example and based on this
modify UC5.1 to rely on client not undestanding an UUID property
Karol: how the PR154 for actions is related to that issue we're discussing
Pavlik: Actions are defining how the resource is related to the
request/operation as it works on one request, and the operation may be
related on other resource
Karol: I've got a gut feeling that the issue related to
resource/template interpretation is big enough to have a separate PR
and is a tool to achieve the PR154 for actions
Pavlik: I could modify the use case to put an explicit UUID so the
variable mapping is not a concern in the PR154
Karol: this way we could focus on the actions in PR154 and introduce a
separate Heracles.ts PR related to IRI template and the operation
invocation API
Pavlik: my another effort would be to have some 'like' example so the
actions could come in handy and provide more details on the PR154
Tomasz: one more thing I wanted to understand about actions and the
API documentation relation
Pavlik: you couldn't define an operation that uses PUT on another
operation in the API documentation, Actions would allow you to do it
Tomasz: supported operations of a supported property allows that
Karol: also IRI template used as a parent of the operation could allow that
Tomasz: these are possibilites, but these are not communicated properties
Pavlik: how UC5.1 could be described in the API documentation? Can you
look at it with existing possibilities?
Tomasz: let's start a new issue: How to perform UC5.1 in API documentation


Action: Pavlik modify UC5 and UC5.1 to use UUID instead of slug
Action: Pavlik actions and operations in API documentation (PR154 in
API documentation)
Action: Karol introduce API changes in the Heracles.ts for IRI templates
Action: Tomasz will start issue: How to perform UC5.1 in API documentation
