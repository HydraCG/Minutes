              <div class="information">.. review it but if you guys say it's ready I trust you</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  I'll address the comments as soon as I find some time</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I still need to clear my mind about hydra:memberTemplate etc.</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... regarding this PR specifically I'm not blocked and will address the outstanding issues shortly</div>

              <div class="information"><a href="https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/pull/154">https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/pull/154</a></div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  Karol, did you have time to have a look?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  I had a glance at it but didn't think enough about it yet</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I need to think it through to be able to properly comment on it</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  I took 2 use cases. The one with PUT and the search one</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I replace the templates with two actions using schema:potentialAction</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I'm using schema:target to make the target explicit</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I just realized that I could also have used the reverse of hydra:operation instead of schema:target</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I find it nice to have all the affordances about a resource in a single place</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... which is why I proposed this design</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  What's your take on the overlap of operations and actions as commented on the PR?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  In principle I agree but in this particular case I don't a see big difference between the two</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I didn't mean to differentiate between information and non-information resources</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I was concerned about separation of the semantics of the request (perform a search) and a description of the HTTP details (make a POST, perform a GET)</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  I see. So you are talking something like a handler of a the action</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  exactly</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  I fail to see why a client would need to understand schema:potentialAction, isn't it like any arbitrary vocabulary</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  would the design make sense to you if potentialAction was part of Hydra?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  kinda, I still struggle to see the connection between these resource and the relation to hydra:memberTemplate</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I don't see the purpose of this as hydra:memberTemplate already solves the problem</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... or what's the benefit?</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... the JavaScript code actually looks exactly the same</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  the advantage of this approach would be that we wouldn't need to introduce lots of other properties such as hydra:memberTemplate for other use cases like search etc.</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... we could handle all of this in a uniform manner by leveraging actions/operations</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... this connects the action directly to the resource it affects, instead of attaching indirectly through a template as with hydra:memberTemplate</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I see the benefit of Pavlik's design as it directly ties the action to the resource</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... with the hydra:memberTemplate design a user would need to introduce both the property and an action type</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... if we wouldn't have it directly in Hydra, a client wouldn't couldn't figure out how to add an item to the collection as it wouldn't know it's relationship to the collection</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  how would a client understand with potentialAction that it adds an item if the template would differ?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  by the action, such as AddAction.. the IRI and thus the template should be opaque</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... if I remember correctly we actually saw an example in the Vimeo API where the target (i.e., the template) differs from the resource itself</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  it sounds interesting but would be quite a change</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  yep</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  are we concerned about breaking existing implementations</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... like Ruben's Linked Data Fragments</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I wouldn't worry too much about that</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... but we should look for ways to make it the least disruptive possible</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... one way I could think of is keeping operation and adding something like hydra:performsAction to the operation that describes the semantics of the operation</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... and then add another property which could be used to point from a resource to a action if it isn't possible to point to the operation directly as the target differs</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... <a href="http://schema.org/Action">http://schema.org/Action</a></div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  What is missing from schema.org is a way to describe that an action introduces a relationship such as in a LikeAction</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... which direction do we want to point? From Action to Operation or vice-versa?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I think we'll need to point both ways</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... anything else we should discuss in regard to this PR?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  should introduce a new use instead of changing use case 5.1?</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... same use case but different approach</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I see. Would you like to keep both approaches eventually or just one?</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  I don't know yet.. I see many uses for Pavlik's approach</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... but the current approach is compelling as well in a few cases as it is so simple</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... so I see benefits in both of them</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I don't have a strong opinion. I think we should just try it out</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">elf Pavlik</span>:  I completely agree. We need to explore this more</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I'm happy to change it to introduce alternatives instead of overwriting it</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  I think we would benefit from trying to describe more complex things with both approaches</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... like having multiple search actions on a collection</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I see link/unlink as very good examples for this as they are tricky to express</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I think the most efficient way forward is to discuss this directly on the PR</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I'll leave a snippet of what I had in mind there</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... Karol, if you have some time, please have another look at the PR and leave some comments too</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  will do in the next couple of days</div>
