              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I think we will quickly hit the limits if we work with a framed JSON-LD doc internally [scribe assist by Markus Lanthaler]</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... we could use flattened JSON-LD</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... or probably even better triples as they are most flexible</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  Agree, triples are the most flexible but definitely not the easiest option [scribe assist by Markus Lanthaler]</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I had, for instance, issues when working with subclassing</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... it lead to manz if/else statements</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... with framing we will hit the wall pretty soon though</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... I used custom object hierarchies in another project</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... but I'm not sure what we should use here</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  The most important thing is to not leak the RDF details through the interface [scribe assist by Markus Lanthaler]</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  we shall give JS objects in the public API</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Karol Szczepański</span>:  ... even if we use triples internally [scribe assist by Markus Lanthaler]</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  completely agree [scribe assist by Markus Lanthaler]</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Tomasz Pluskiewicz</span>:  got some experience with RDFext but it was very heavy</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... it was quite difficult to work with thus plain RDF under the hood may require good tooling</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  we may store triples in an array but let's push the limits with framing</div>
              <div class="comment-continuation">... no more topics in the agenda</div>
              <div class="information">the conference has ended</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: what I said was that we could start with a simple array of triples that we filter etc. as I don't expect us to have millions of triples in a single response and see how far that brings us before we hit performance issues</div>
              <div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: I didn't suggest to push the limits of framing... if we want to go that route, I would suggest to use flattened JSON-LD internally instead</div>
